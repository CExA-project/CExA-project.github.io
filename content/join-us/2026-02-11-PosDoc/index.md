# 🚀 Job Offer: C++/HPC PostDoc - MLIR / JAX / Pytorch / Kokkos

## 🧭 Context

The European HPC landscape is transforming rapidly with the emergence of **Exascale** systems like the upcoming *Alice Recoque* supercomputer at **CEA**. These heterogeneous architectures require new programming paradigms to maintain performance and portability across varied GPU and CPU vendors.

To address this challenge, the **CExA "Moonshot"** initiative contributes to key software infrastructure like **Kokkos** and leverages modern compiler frameworks such as **MLIR** (Multi-level Intermediate Representation) to establish a sustainable approach for domain experts to develop their applications without deep understanding of the modern programming models and architectures. For this purpose, we will explore the coupling technology of kokkos/python with MLIR to allow code developers to maintain kokkos codes only with the python expertise. As a case study, we will port a legacy fortran application for MDFT (Molecular Density Functional Theory) with modern programming approaches including Kokkos, Kokkos/python and python. Then, we will evaluate the performance portability, readability, productivity and mainatinability aspects of each approach to find a reasonable programming model to develop a code for domain scientists.

This position is a 2 years posistion as part of CExA’s efforts to integrate advanced techniques, including **JAX-based or PyTorch-based AI models**, into our HPC workflows, fostering hybrid workloads that combine simulation and machine learning.

## 🎯 Mission

As a core member of the MDFT and CExA teams, your mission will be to **develop, prototype, and evaluate tools and methodologies** for performance optimization of MLIR-Kokkos-based HPC applications. A publication at highly competitive conferences such as Supercomputing is forseen.

### Your main responsibilities will include:

* 🔧 **Tooling Development**

  * Introduce a **Kokkos dialect** in **MLIR** as an intermediate representation of Kokkos
  * Implement a translation inflastructure (based on potentially existing intermediate dialects) between Kokkos and JAX / PyTorch

* 📈 **Code Optimization**

  * Profile and optimize MDFT across multiple architectures (Nvidia GPUs, AMD CPUs/GPUs, Intel CPUs)
  * Evaluate integration opportunities for AI-based models via **JAX** or **PyTorch** to support hybrid workflows

* 🤝 **Collaboration & Outreach**

  * Collaborate with other CEA teams and international partners (Europe, US, Japan)
  * Present results in conferences, workshops, and open-source contributions

## 🧠 Skills

You are a passionate engineer with a background in scientific computing and a drive to push the boundaries of performance portability.

### Must-have:

* Experience with LLVM, or compiler infrastructure
* Proficiency in **modern C++ (17 or later)**

### Bonus:

* Experience with performance optimization and profiling tools (e.g., VTune, Nsight)
* Familiarity with **Kokkos** or other GPU portability frameworks
* Familiarity with **MLIR**, or compiler infrastructure
* Solid software engineering practice: git, cmake, CI/CD, unit testing
* Knowledge of **JAX** or **PyTorch** and interest in ML or DL for scientific applications

---

## 💼 Salary & Benefits

* Competitive salary based on experience and qualifications
* Up to **3 remote days/week**
* **75% reimbursement** of public transport costs
* 5 weeks of vacation + 4 weeks RTT
* **International exposure**: conferences, workshops, and collaborative projects
* Health insurance, retirement savings plans, and more
