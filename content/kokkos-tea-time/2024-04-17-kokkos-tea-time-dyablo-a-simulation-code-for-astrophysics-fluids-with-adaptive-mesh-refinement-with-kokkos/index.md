## Dyablo: A simulation code for astrophysics fluids with adaptive mesh refinement with Kokkos

*Arnaud Durocher, Maxime Delorme, CEA-Saclay, IRFU/DEDIP/LILAS*

Dyablo is a new code for the simulation of astrophysical plasmas on exascale architectures using Adaptive Mesh Refinement. It is built from the ground up to target new and upcoming Exascale supercomputers with a new codebase in C++ using Kokkos. Dyablo is based on modern software engineering principles to allow "separation of concerns" and collaboration between HPC engineers and physicists through abstract interfaces and modularity. Although Dyablo is still in development, the code is now deployable and usable on all major (French) supercomputers.

We will present Dyablo, how it's made and what challenges had to be resolved for AMR on GPUs. We will also present two physical problems we resolve with Dyablo in solar physics and cosmology.
