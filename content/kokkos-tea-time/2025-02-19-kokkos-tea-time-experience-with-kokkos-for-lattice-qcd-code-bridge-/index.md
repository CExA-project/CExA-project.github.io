## Experience with Kokkos for Lattice QCD Code Bridge++

Keigo Nitadori will share some insights from his initial experience developing with the Kokkos framework. The target was a Lattice QCD code, specifically the Domain-wall Fermion kernel from a Japanese community code set, Bridge++.  

One of the initial challenges was that even a simple "Hello World" code required adequate knowledge of CMAKE for successful builds, posing a significant barrier for first-time users. To integrate Kokkos with Bridge++ without disrupting their conventions, careful attention was paid to maintaining loose coupling through techniques like the pImpl idiom.

Regarding performance, the NVIDIA GH200 environment delivered sufficient FLOPS and effective bandwidth, as expected from the GPU specifications. In contrast, the AMD MI250 environment presented significant unresolved performance challenges.
