## Cabana: a Kokkos+MPI library for particles and hybrid particle-grid applications

A wide range of computational methods center on particles, from atomistic predictions to cosmology. Cabana is a library built on Kokkos and MPI for performance portable and scalable particle simulation. In addition, Cabana includes structured grids for hybrid particle-grid methods. The current library capabilities will be discussed, as well as applications using Cabana and plans for future work. Cabana and many Cabana-based mini applications are available at https://github.com/ECP-CoPA
