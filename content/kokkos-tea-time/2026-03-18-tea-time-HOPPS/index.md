Alexandre Dutka will give a talk entitled "HOPPS: A performance portable spectral difference solver for high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics"


Alexandre Dutka is a software engineer and PhD student at CERFACS, mainly interested in high-performance software design, performance portability, GPU computing, and high-order numerics for CFD. His research currently focuses on tree-based adaptive mesh refinement techniques and their use in the context of modern high-fidelity CFD frameworks. He is also a regular open-source contributor, focused on hardening existing HPC libraries and filling the feature gaps highlighted by his research.

## HOPPS: A performance portable spectral difference solver for high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics

High-fidelity CFD simulations are costly, making it crucial to support GPUs and adapt numerical methods to fully leverage this new HPC hardware. Discontinuous high-order methods, which offer geometric flexibility and high efficiency on memory-bound systems, are particularly promising in this regard. We developed a high-order solver using Kokkos and benchmarked it across diverse CPU and GPU architectures. The results validate this approach, demonstrating its ability to combine high-order accuracy and performance portability.
