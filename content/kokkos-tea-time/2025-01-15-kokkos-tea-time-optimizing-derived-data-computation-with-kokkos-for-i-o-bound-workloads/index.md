Ana Gainaru will give a talk on "Optimizing Derived Data Computation with Kokkos for I/O-Bound Workloads"

<!-- ![](portrait.jpg "") -->

Ana Gainaru is a computer scientist in the CSM division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, working on performance optimization for large scale scientific applications and on profiling, managing, and analyzing large-scale data. She received her PhD from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and has a background in optimizing the execution of scientific applications at every level of the software stack, from data-aware runtime design to scheduling, fault tolerance and code optimization.

## Optimizing Derived Data Computation with Kokkos for I/O-Bound Workloads

Scientific data analysis often involves complex queries across distributed datasets, requiring manipulation of multiple variables and generating derived data on the fly. Derived quantities are obtained by mathematical transformations of primary data (generated directly by applications) and allow researchers to focus in their analysis on specific aspects of their simulation. For example, in combustion simulations, calculating the magnitude of the velocity (primary data) creates a derived variable that effectively identifies areas of high interest, such as regions with intense burning. In this talk I will present optimization opportunities when the decision on when to compute the derived variables is offloaded to the I/O library and how Kokkos can be used to handled them efficiently for I/O intensive applications.
