Yuuichi Asahi is a Research Scientist in CEA, Maison de la Simulation. He has focused on the nonlinear plasma turbulence by means of gyrokinetic simulations. High performance computing and large scale data management are key ingredients for these simulations. His current interests include accelerating the gyrokinetic simulation codes for more complicated physics and analysing the large scale simulation results with machine and/or deep learning methods.
