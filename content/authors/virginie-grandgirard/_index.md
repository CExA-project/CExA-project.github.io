Dr. Virginie Grandgirard received the PhD degree in mathematics and applications from Besancon University, France, in 1999. She then obtained the Habilitation Ã  Diriger des Recherches in 2016. She is presently researcher with CEA, France. She is one of the main developer of the 5D non-linear gyrokinetic semi-Lagrangian code GYSELA used for plasma turbulence simulations. This code is highly parallelized up to hundreds of thousands cores. Her research interests focus on numerical methods for Vlasov equations, high performance computing and tokamak plasma turbulence. She has co-authored 50 publications in peer-reviewed journals.
