Hello!

I pursued my engineering studies at ENSTA Paris, followed by an MSc in Applied Mathematics, specializing in Modeling and Simulation at Institut Polytechnique de Paris. For my concluding internship, I had the privilege of working at LBNL in Berkeley, focusing on optimizing PIC codes implemented in WarpX.

As a member of CEA's CExA team since the end of 2023, I'll be working on the Kokkos library to prepare the transition of codes to GPU.
