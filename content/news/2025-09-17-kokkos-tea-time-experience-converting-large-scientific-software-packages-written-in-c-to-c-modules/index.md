Wolfgang Bangerth is a professor of mathematics and geosciences at Colorado State University, USA. He holds an undergraduate degree in physics, and a PhD in mathematics from Heidelberg University, Germany. As a graduate student in 1997, he co-founded the deal.II project (https://www.dealii.org), a widely used software library that provides finite element functionality. He is now one of the Principal Developers of the project.

## Experience converting large scientific software packages written in C++ to C++20 modules

Many of the most widely used scientific software libraries are written in C++, but almost all of them still use the traditional header-based approach inherited from C to connect declarations provided in one file to uses and implementations in another file. On the other hand, C++20 has introduced a module system that is intended to give C++ a proper "import" statement that goes beyond the textual inclusion of "#include".

In this talk, I will outline my experience with converting the deal.II finite element library -- a library with 1.8M lines of C++ -- to use C++20-style modules. I will discuss how I did this from a technical perspective, and in particular how that actually works in practice.
