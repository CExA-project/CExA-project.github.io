CExA will hold its kick-off in Neurospin Amphitheatre on the 19th of Septembre.

If you have always dreamt to start with GPU computing or if you are a Kokkos user and have hit bumps on the road and wonder how CExA can help you, this is the day for you.
This presentation day will be an opportunity to get to know CExA and its environment better.
