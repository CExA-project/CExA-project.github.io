The CExA team, together with Damien Lebrun-Grandie (ORNL) and Luc Berger-Vergiat (SNL), are happy to welcome you again for our next Kokkos training days.

The Kokkos C++ Performance Portability Ecosystem is a production level solution for writing modern applications in a hardware agnostic way. It is part of the US Department of Energies Exascale Project. The Ecosystem consists of multiple libraries addressing the primary concerns for developing and maintaining applications in a portable way. The three main components are the Kokkos Core Programming Model, the Kokkos Kernels Math Libraries and the Kokkos Profiling and Debugging Tools.
