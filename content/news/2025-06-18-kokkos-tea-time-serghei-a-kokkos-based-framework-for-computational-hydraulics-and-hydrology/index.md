Daniel Caviedes-Voullieme will give a talk on "SERGHEI: a Kokkos-based framework for computational hydraulics and hydrology"

<!-- ![](portrait.jpg "") -->

Daniel Caviedes-Voullieme is a computational hydrologist. He is the team leader of the Simulation and Data Laboratory for Terrestrial Systems of the Jülich Supercomputing Centre (Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany). He obtained a Civil Engineering degree from the University of Costa Rica, an Msc in Applied Mechanics and a PhD degree from the University of Zaragoza. He has previously held research and teaching positions at the University of Zaragoza (ES), University of Sheffield (UK) and BTU Cottbus-Senftenberg (DE). His research is centered around high-performing, performance-portable and scalable numerical solvers for hydrodynamics and hydrology, and their application for environmental hydraulics and hydrology across scales.

## SERGHEI: a Kokkos-based framework for computational hydraulics and hydrology

The Simulation EnviRonment for Geomorphology, Hydrodynamics and Ecohydrology in Integrated form (SERGHEI) is a Kokkos-based project which couples a variety of solvers for environmental processes driven by hydrodynamics. Aiming at performance-portability, it was developed from the start on Kokkos, and is currently being extended by a growing international team. In this talk we will introduce SERGHEI and its goals, showcase some of its scientific features and applications, and report some of experiences implementing and testing it. Additionally, we will report on the ongoing investigation of the performance-portability and scalability of SERGHEI on exascale systems.
