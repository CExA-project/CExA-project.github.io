        CEA, ASNR (ex IRSN) and EDF have joined forces and started the development of the TRIPOLI-5&reg;
        Monte Carlo particle transport code in 2022[^1], with the goal of performing massively parallel simulations on
        hybrid computing architectures. TRIPOLI-5 benefits from the experience gained from previous investigations
        conducted on the PATMOS mini-app, concerning the portability of particle-transport algorithms in
        High Performance Computing environments. Currently, the main focus of TRIPOLI-5 is on reactor physics
        applications, including multi-physics feedback for stationary and non-stationary configurations. In the long
        run, TRIPOLI-5 will eventually cover a broader range of applications (encompassing radiation shielding
        and nuclear instrumentation) and thus supersede the current-generation Monte Carlo codes [TRIPOLI-4&reg;](https://www.cea.fr/energies/tripoli-4/Pages/Code%20features/Code_features.aspx),
        developed at CEA, and MORET6, developed at ASNR (ex IRSN).
